# Stevens Senior D Transitfeeds Team 2023-24

Our AI-driven implementation to serve as a POC on how to 
optimize time/cost via multimodal transit in a major city.

## Description

These past two semesters, building off of previous TLCEngine teams and online implementations that we have used, tested, and worked to further optimize we aim to create our own AI-driven proof of concept. Here we try to implement new open source efforts along with any optimization algorithms for the MultiModal Transit problem. Multimodal Transit is the use of multiple modes of transportation to reach a destination. This route involves any two or more routes through vessles such as Driving, Ferries, Busses, Trains, Subways, Lightrails, etc. The goal for this project is to further find any ways to estimate, optimize, and provide optimization for time and cost of this travel type for the daily commuter. 

### How to Run Application

1. Clone the repository using git or download a zip of it and then install the needed node module packages using:
```
npm install
```

2. Next you can run the program using the following command in a terminal:
